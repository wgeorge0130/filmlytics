Our goal in this project is to better understand feature films (a.k.a movies) and the factual statistics in regards to a film's details which includes but is not limited to film genre, director, main star, runtime, release date, IMDB score, votes, country of production, budget, and gross. We constructed visual models of both quantitative and qualitative analytics to explore relationships and correlations between different attributes as well as discovering specific trends. Utilizing the public datasets “Movie Industry” and “Countries of the World” from Kaggle, we were able to collect sufficient data to conduct our qualitative and quantitative analysis (Grijalva, 2021; Marek, 2018). Our strategies are outlined in four specific data analysis tasks. In our first task, we explored the top n genres based on a score-vote criteria which is score multiplied with the number of votes. The user is able to decide the n value so long as   n > 0 and n <= 6000 (which is relatively the max size of the data set) for an intuitive interactive application design. A visualization of a bar graph will pop up with the selected n value to give us the distribution of genres. In our second task, we qualitatively examined the top genres produced per country and utilized a unique global map-legend data visualization technique to illustrate and present each top genre with the country location. In our third task, we analyzed the relationship between GDP found in our “Countries of the World” dataset of a country and average budget-gross ratio computed metric of films in each country. Each country was represented as a point in a scatter plot for visual observation. Finally, in our fourth data analytics task, we explored the relationship between profit and a film’s score for each of the films in our movies dataset, then, utilized a profit-score metric to determine the top N directors based on this profit multiplied score criteria and illustrated such via a bar graph. The user can intuitively input the N value via our application command line so long as n > 0 and n <= 10.
